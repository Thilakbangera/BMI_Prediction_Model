BMI_Prediction_Model<br>
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict Body Mass Index (BMI) based on input features.<br>
The model's accuracy is demonstrated through a visualization that plots the predicted values against the expected BMI values, <br>
showing a close alignment along the diagonal, which indicates high predictive accuracy.<br>
The provided graph illustrates the model's effectiveness, with predicted BMI values aligning well with the actual values, <br>
as shown by the green scatter points and the red diagonal trendline.<br>
This visualization is useful for evaluating the model's performance and reliability.<br>
X-axis: Shows the actual BMI values from the data.<br>
Y-axis: Shows the BMI values predicted by the model.<br>
Red Line: Represents perfect predictions. Points on this line mean the predicted value equals the actual value.<br>
Green Dots: Each dot shows one prediction. The closer a dot is to the red line, the more accurate that prediction is.<br>
Model Accuracy: Most dots are near the red line, meaning the modelâ€™s predictions are very accurate.<br>
This plot helps quickly see how well the model predicts BMI.<br>
